# Introduction
Ensuring safe drinking water is essential for public health. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the potability of water based on physical and chemical properties. The model can assist in identifying unsafe water sources and aid in water quality management.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle's Water Potability[Kaggle's Water Potability Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/adityakadiwal/water-potability)
 Dataset. It contains several water quality indicators such as pH, Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, Sulfate, Conductivity, Organic Carbon, Trihalomethanes, and Turbidity.

# Data Preprocessing
The data_preprocessing.py script and corresponding Jupyter notebook handle the following steps:

-Handling missing values
-Feature scaling
-Encoding categorical variables (if any)
-Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
- Modelling and Evaluation
  
# Modeling

The model.py script and Jupyter notebook cover:
Model selection (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier,KNN Classifier)
Training the models on the training data

# Evaluation
The evaluate.py script and Jupyter notebook include:
Performance metrics (accuracy, mean square Error and R2_score)
Confusion matrix

# Results
The results section presents the performance of different models, highlighting the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics. Key findings and observations from the model performance are discussed.

# Conclusion
The conclusion summarizes the project outcomes, the effectiveness of the machine learning models in predicting water potability, and the potential real-world applications of the developed model.

# Future Work
This section outlines possible improvements and future directions for the project, such as:

-Incorporating more water quality parameters
-Applying advanced machine learning techniques
-Real-time water quality monitoring
